I conducted this experiment in mid 2022 to order to see if we could observe the results of Zipf's Law in a relatively small data sample. 
I procured the data from my school as namelist hardcopies which were then scanned and converted to .txt files using certain applications.

Due to the significant variation of the spellings of names, much correction had to be done by hand. It did not occur to me back then to use an Artificially Intelligent tool for this task. 
I had to write two scripts to normalise the spellings of names and then one more to sort these games by gender semi automatically. I have not included these scripts in this repository. 

The processed data was then plotted and results were consolidated in a .pdf file.
