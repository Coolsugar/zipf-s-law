This project aims at determining if Zipf's Law is applicable for a (relatively small) set of names. 

Data was procured from my school's student namelists. Hardcopies were converted to .txt files using AI.

Data had to be processed due to the significant variation in the spellings of certain names that recurred. Names were also segregated on the basis of sex. At the time (2022) AI was not in heavy use and much of this work had to be done manually, assissted with python programs. These scripts have been excluded from this repository (I've lost them :D).

The data was processed and plotted. 

Results were inconclusive.
